gcp2gdalscript.pl takes a set of GCPs as a .points file along with the original
raster and creates a shell script with a bunch of gdal commands to actually
warp the image and produce a bunch of other metadata files. Run the perl script
with no arguments to see the usage hint.

gdalinfo2kml.pl takes a .gdalinfo file created by gcp2gdalscript.pl and
reformats it into a KML file so you can see the warped images in a product that
supports KML GroundOverlays.

You can convert the warped rasters into an OSM slippy map tile structure using,

   gdal2tiles.py --profile='mercator' --s_srs='WGS84' warped_jpg_with_wld_file tile_output/

, followed by a (in the tile_output directory) (see http://groups.google.com/group/maptiler/browse_thread/thread/aa89fc726b8f7261/8bdc39d7829cc80c
),

   for I in `find . -type f -maxdepth 3 -mindepth 2 -name *.png`
    do OLDNAME=`basename $I .png`
    DIRNAME=`dirname $I`
    SEP1=${I#./}
    SEP2=${SEP1%%/*}
    NEWNAME=$((2**$SEP2-$OLDNAME-1))
    mv "$I" "$DIRNAME"/"$NEWNAME.png"
   done 

Don't ask me why I made the gcp2gdalscript.pl script write a shell script
instead of just having perl run those commands when you run the perl script. I
wasn't really thinking when I started and one thing lead to another. I may
refactor it later, but it seems to be working okay for now.

Its comforting to know that I'm not the only one constructing strings for
passing to the gdal suit, rather than directly calling the GDAL API. From
browsing through the mapwarper code http://github.com/timwaters/mapwarper/ it
seems to do it too.
