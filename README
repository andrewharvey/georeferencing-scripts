This repository contains a bunch of scripts I've been using to help automate
georeferencing some digitised old paper maps.

There are two main work flows I've been using so far.
 1. from-map-grid was used for maps that have a grid drawn on them.
 2. from-gcps was used for maps which have no grid drawn on them.

The third folder "common" is for the common scripts, that can be used from
the output of either of the above two approaches.

More details can be found in each of the folders.
