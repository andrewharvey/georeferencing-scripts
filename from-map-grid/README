For the maps that had a grid on them like as shown in sample_original.jpg I used
Inkscape to trace the lines of latitude and label these paths with the
coordinates of these lines. I then used the perl script to generate a .points
file which contains all the ground control points (GCPs) from the tracing.

The script is very unstable and it may not warn when things are going wrong, so
if you use it, use it with caution.

Basically my work flow was,

1. I opened the original map in Inkscape,
2. then using the tool to draw straight multi-segment lines,
3. for each line of latitude (horizontal line), going from left to right, I
4.   added a node in the line at each intersection with a line of longitude
     (vertical line). No lines of longitude are skipped, if you need to skip one
     end the line, then start a new line segment. That horizontal path is then
     named with an id of lat${lat}_lon${startLon-endLon}. Then -endLon is
     optional and if omitted only the first point in the line is used.

See the sample_traced.svg file for an example.

The next step is to run extract-coords.pl on this SVG file. This should
(remember the script is not robust) give you a GCP file which is a set of
control points that relates positions on the raster image to georeferenced
coordinates.

If extract-coords.pl gives you any error messages or warnings, anything in
addition to the "Found n GCPs." then there was a problem, probably with your
labelling of the paths.
